# eCommerce-Transactions-Dataset
Customer Segmentation and Clustering
Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation through clustering techniques. It involves analyzing customer transaction data to identify distinct groups or segments based on various metrics. The main goal is to understand customer behavior and provide actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.

Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the customer transaction dataset.
Preprocess and clean the data to ensure it’s ready for clustering.
Apply clustering techniques (KMeans) to segment customers.
Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index.
Provide actionable business insights based on the clustering results.

Files Description
/data: This directory contains the raw data files, including customer transactions and product details.

transactions.csv: Contains customer transaction records, including customer ID, product ID, transaction date, quantity, and total value.
products.csv: Contains product details, including product ID, price, and category.
/scripts: This directory contains Python scripts for data processing and analysis.

data_preprocessing.py: Contains functions for data cleaning, merging datasets, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.
clustering.py: Contains the logic for applying KMeans clustering and evaluating results.
/reports: This directory includes the final report.

customer_segmentation_report.pdf: This is the final PDF report containing business insights, the results of customer segmentation, and the clustering analysis.
Installation
Clone the repository or download the files.

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include the necessary libraries such as:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
How to Run the Code
Data Preprocessing: Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and prepare the data for clustering.
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
Clustering: Run the clustering.py script to perform customer segmentation using KMeans clustering.
python scripts/clustering.py
The results, including the Davies-Bouldin index, will be printed to the console.

Report Generation: The final report with insights based on clustering will be saved in the /reports directory.
Business Insights
The final report provides insights on:

Customer behavior patterns based on transaction data.
Identification of customer segments with distinct characteristics.
How these insights can be leveraged for targeted marketing and personalized offers.
Conclusion
By analyzing customer data and performing clustering, this project enables better understanding of customer needs and behaviors. These insights can be used to optimize business strategies such as marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and customer service.
